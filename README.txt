All code was made by me, Alex Jans, or supplied in the lecture demos, https://github.com/sifakis/CS559F21_Demos. Photos were taken by either me or my mom of our family dog Copernicus. The box is as empty as his head. The model is pretty simple and derived, but I feel the complexity of the texturing and the shaders especially make up for it. The fragment has specular and diffuse and warps the sides of the box to unfold like the "Only A Northern Song" scene of the movie Yellow Submarine.
The shaders also switch to a "cooler" Coop or can swap his ears for "hands."
I was inspired by both watching that movie recently and getting to use my dog in a project. It is still surprising that the dog from the demos is unknown, just so happened to be in a convienient image to use. 
Hopefully you enjoy.

Also, the speeding up of the flapping was unintentional but kept. Almost mimics him getting excited from attention.
